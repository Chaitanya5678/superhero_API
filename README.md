# superhero_API

This project is a demonstration of connecting to APIs using javascript.

I used [Superhero API](https://superheroapi.com/) in this project.

This has three components mainly.
1. The home page which contains a search bar to navigate to web pages of different characters.
2. The 'SuperHero' page which is a dynamically formed webpage that renders content after hitting API link.
3. The 'My Favourites' page that displays all favourite characters that are stored persistently in browser localStorage. 

Note: Do not use the access token mentioned in the code. Generate your own access token by signing into facebook in the API's website mentioned above.
